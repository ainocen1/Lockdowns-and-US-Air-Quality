This folder contains daily area-weighted average values of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at the census tract level for the contiguous US, for the December to May periods from 2015 to 2022.

AOD is a unitless measure of tiny solid and liquid particulates, which includes smoke, dust, and particulate matter, where higher levels are associated with higher air pollution.

This data is publicly available through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product on NASA’s Terra satellite, collected daily at a 3 km spatial resolution.
