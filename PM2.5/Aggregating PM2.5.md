This contains daily area-weighted average values of PM2.5 from EPA's monitor data, aggregated at the census tract level, for the contiguous US for Dec to May periods from 2015 to 2022.

I use the pre-generated data files (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2022) and assign the daily PM2.5 monitor readings to all census tracts covered by that monitor.6 Monitor location is not random. EPA requires PM2.5 monitors to be in sites expected to have maximum PM concentrations, metropolitan areas with at least 1 million in population, and areas where there is poor air quality.

Note that these monitors cover different distances depending on their purpose – from microscale (0 to 100 m) to regional scale (50 to hundreds of km). See table below.

The PM2.5 data here comes from the AQS monitor database, keep only PM2.5 Local Conditions or parameter code “88101.”
